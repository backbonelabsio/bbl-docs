## What is Necropolis?

An NFT marketplace platform for buying, selling and trading NFTs (non-fungible tokens). The Necropolis marketplace operates on blockchain technology to verify asset ownership and transactions. NFTs are units of data (unique code) that provide a secure record of ownership on a blockchain infrastructure.

## Fueling Necropolis: bASSETs and the GraveDigger

### **The Role of bASSETs**

Necropolis operates with the [GraveDiggers](../bbl-assets/gravedigger-lsts/) bASSETs at its heart. By integrating bASSETs, Necropolis allows users to maximize their capital, earning yield while participating in NFT transactions. This dual functionality—trading NFTs and generating yield—sets Necropolis apart from traditional NFT marketplaces.

### **The Heart of Necropolis: The GraveDigger**

At the core of Necropolis lies the GraveDigger, a crucial mechanism driving the marketplace's efficiency. The GraveDigger's ability to manage and optimize capital through LSTs enables explosive growth in the NFT market's capital efficiency. It acts as the lifeblood of Necropolis, ensuring the continuous flow and productive use of capital within the ecosystem.

## Marketplace of the Dead: Unique and Resilient

### **Diversification and Resilience**

The GraveDigger, through its partnerships with multiple Layer 1 blockchains, introduces natural diversification. This strategy mitigates risks associated with single points of failure, ensuring that the marketplace and its community remain secure and stable even in volatile conditions.

### **Solving Real Problems**

By launching and partnering with various L1 blockchains, the GraveDigger addresses real issues, enhancing the marketplace's functionality and user experience. This collaboration extends beyond mere transactions, solving critical inefficiencies in the NFT space and providing a safe, reliable platform for users.

## Community and Sustainability

### **Community-Driven Model**

Necropolis emphasizes a community-driven approach, redistributing marketplace fees and rewards to [$SOUL](../usdsoul/) token stakers. This model fosters a sense of ownership and engagement within the community, ensuring that benefits are shared equitably among participants. By involving the community in the ecosystem's growth, Necropolis cultivates a loyal and active user base.

### **Sustainable Growth**

The fee-sharing mechanism extends to bASSET LSTs, with a portion of performance fees from the GraveDigger also distributed to $SOUL stakers and [GraveDigger NFT](../gravedigger-nft-communities/) stakers. This approach ensures sustainability by continuously reinvesting in the ecosystem, promoting long-term growth and stability.

### Conclusion

Necropolis is more than just an NFT marketplace; it's a revolutionary platform that integrates advanced blockchain technology with innovative financial mechanisms. By leveraging bASSETs and the GraveDigger, Necropolis enhances capital efficiency, ensures resilience through diversification, and fosters a community-driven, sustainable ecosystem. Join Necropolis to experience the future of NFT trading, where efficiency, security, and community engagement converge.
